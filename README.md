<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Fast-Pizza
Our web application is a convenient and user-friendly platform for ordering delicious pizzas from a menu. We prioritize simplicity and speed, so there's no need for user accounts or Login. Users can input their names before using the app.
The ordering process is flexible and allows users to add multiple pizzas to their cart before placing their final order. To ensure a smooth delivery experience, users can also grant access to their GPS location, making it easier for our delivery team to find them.
Users only need to provide their name, phone number, and address when making an order. We value our customers' time, so we've added a special 'priority' option that allows users to expedite their orders for an additional 20% fee.
Payment is hassle-free and handled on delivery, ensuring a seamless experience from start to finish. We are committed to providing the best pizza and service possible, making every order a delightful experience for our valued customers.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
